                    <p>Giraffe’s are vital to keeping ecosystems in balance. They eat the browse that others cannot reach, 
                        which promotes growth of forage and opens up areas for themselves and other smaller browsers to 
                        make use of. Importantly this means that by protecting Africa’s giraffes, we are protecting other species too. Giraffe’s lives are so intertwined with Acai trees that some seedlings do not germinate until they have passed through the giraffe’s digestive system.</p>
                       <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                        <p>giraffes live in grasslands and open woodlands in East Africa, especially in reserves such as the Serengeti National Park and the Amboseli National Park.</p>
